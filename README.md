Our project will be focusing on adding components to the camera module so it may function as a security camera. We will construct it so it can rotate to completely cover an outdoor area. We are focusing on an outdoor area because it will only turn on when it becomes daytime. Our project will have a camera attached to a servo motor. We have already researched how we would connect the two. There will also be a photoresistor that would be orientated to the sky so that while the resistance is measured. We would measure this value by using a voltage divider. This way we can add an analog-to-digital converter to read the value, similar to what we did with the temperature measuring module. The last part of our camera would be the "security" part in the security camera. We would attach an infrared sensor to the circuit, along with the camera, to identify if something with a heat signature moves. When/If motion is detected would take a screenshot of what the camera is seeing. We would then send this image via email to the owner to alert him.
